# ExpressFlame

ExpressFlame is a function wrapper that converts express middleware functions to work with Flamewire.
Just because it allows it to function doesn't mean that it will be compatible with Flamewire.

With more testing a series of working modules will be added to the the list. Feel free to add more to the list.
